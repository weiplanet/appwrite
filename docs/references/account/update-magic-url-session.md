Use this endpoint to complete creating the session with the Magic URL. Both the **userId** and **secret** arguments will be passed as query parameters to the redirect URL you have provided when sending your request to the [POST /account/sessions/magic-url](/docs/client/account#accountCreateMagicURLSession) endpoint.

Please note that in order to avoid a [Redirect Attack](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md) the only valid redirect URLs are the ones from domains you have set when adding your platforms in the console interface.
