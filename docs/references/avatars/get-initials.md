Use this endpoint to show your user initials avatar icon on your website or app. By default, this route will try to print your logged-in user name or email initials. You can also overwrite the user name if you pass the 'name' parameter. If no name is given and no user is logged, an empty avatar will be returned.

You can use the color and background params to change the avatar colors. By default, a random theme will be selected. The random theme will persist for the user's initials when reloading the same theme will always return for the same initials.
