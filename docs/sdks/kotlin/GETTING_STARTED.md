## Getting Started

### Init your SDK

Initialize your SDK with your Appwrite server API endpoint and project ID which can be found in your project settings page and your new API secret Key project API keys section.

```kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Account

suspend fun main() {
    val client = Client(context)
      .setEndpoint("https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1") // Your API Endpoint
      .setProject("5df5acd0d48c2") // Your project ID
      .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
      .setSelfSigned(true) // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert
}
```

### Make Your First Request

Once your SDK object is set, create any of the Appwrite service objects and choose any request to send. Full documentation for any service method you would like to use can be found in your SDK documentation or in the [API References](https://appwrite.io/docs) section.

```kotlin
val users = Users(client)
val response = users.create(
    email = "email@example.com",
    password = "password",
)
val json = response.body?.string()
```

### Full Example

```kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Users

suspend fun main() {
    val client = Client(context)
      .setEndpoint("https://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1") // Your API Endpoint
      .setProject("5df5acd0d48c2") // Your project ID
      .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key
      .setSelfSigned(true) // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert

    val users = Users(client)
    val response = users.create(
        email = "email@example.com",
        password = "password",
    )
    val json = response.body?.string()
}
```

### Error Handling

The Appwrite Kotlin SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```kotlin
import io.appwrite.Client
import io.appwrite.services.Users

suspend fun main() {
    val users = Users(client)
    try {
        val response = users.create(
            email = "email@example.com",
            password = "password",
        )
        var jsonString = response.body?.string() ?: ""

    } catch (e: AppwriteException) {
        println(e)
    }
}
```
